# KDM_Summer_2016_Cognitos
Our motivation for this project stemmed from having to read dozens of research papers to understand all the terms in a single research paper. There is no simple way of understanding a research article, the information from the internet sources like Wikipedia doesnâ€™t provide a clear insight into many technical concepts. Having experienced first-hand, we realized the importance of a system which can provide a concise summary of a research article.
We further aspire to extend this system as a knowledge graph, which can be used as a handy search tool by students to find articles, summaries of articles, authors, and domains. This system has the potential to be useful in many different ways: an aspiring student can explore research papers in a particular domain, a search engine can crawl through the knowledge graph for relevant search results, etc.,
