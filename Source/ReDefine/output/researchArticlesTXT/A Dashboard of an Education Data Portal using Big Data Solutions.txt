teaching and learning as it contains useful resources. Every

big educational institutions such as university shall build an

EDP soon or later. The aim of this study is to utilize Big Data

solutions in building a Dashboard for an Education Data

Portal. The proposed EDP is envisioned to be a core tool for

all students and learning agencies, providing support for many

types of views and content/instructional resources to allow

effective data-driven decision-making for students, teacher

and the public, based on recent standards. It supports many

features such as accessibility of data and content anywhere,

scalability, extensibility of functionality, and extensibility of

the technology architecture to support integration with the

Shared Learning Infrastructure (SLI).

INTRODUCTION

An Educational Data Portal (EDP) play important role in

teaching and learning as it contains useful resources[1]. Many

succesful implemntation of portals are proposed suc as

StarBRITE, Vanderbilt University Biomedical Research

Integration, Translation and Education portal [2]. Every big

educational institutions such as university shall build an EDP

soon or later. The aim of this study is to utilize Big Data

solutions in building a Dashboard for an Education Data

Portal. Section 2 reviews main terms and tools for Big Data

solutions. Section 3 is the proposed framework. Section 4

invesitages the proposed framework.

PREVIOUS WORK

It is often assumed that Big Data resources are too large and

complex for human comprehension. The analysis of Big Data

is best left to software programs. Not so.

When data analysts go straight to the complex calculations,

before they perform a simple estimation, they will find

themselves accepting wildly ridiculous calculations. [3] Rapid

increases in high performance computing sets the stage for so-

called "big data" analysis challenges. However, conventional climate analysis techniques are inadequate in dealing with the

complexities of today's data. [4]. Big data are of special

Volume, Variety, and Velocity([5], [6]). A data warehouse stores a substantial amount of historical data. Users of this

system are able to continuously ask or query it to retrieve data

for analysis. [7] A data warehouse is a database containing

data from multiple operational systems that has been

consolidated, integrated, aggregated, and structured, so that it

can be used to support the analysis and decision-making

process of a business. [8] The data warehouse model is

constructed from two relational data model schemas covering

demographics and inventory-accounting. [9]

Building a data warehouse requires focusing closely on

understanding three main areas: the source area, the

destination area, and the mapping area (Extraction- transformation-loading, ETL processes). [10]. MapReduce has become an important distributed processing model for

large-scale data-intensive applications like data mining and

web indexing. There is a predictive schedule and prefetching

(PSP) mechanism, that reduces the execution time, increases

the overall throughput and improves the I/O utilization. [11].

MapReduce is a parallel programming model to process large

datasets, and it was inspired by the Map and Reduce

primitives from functional languages. Its first implementation

was designed to run on large clusters of homogeneous

machines ([12],[13]) MapReduce's execution model includes an all-map-to-all-reduce communication, called the shuffle,

across the network bisection. [14]. Hadoop-an open-source imple- mentation of MapReduce is widely used for short jobs

requiring low response time. [15]. Hadoop Technology Stack

is shown in figure 1.

Hive is a batch-oriented, data-warehousing layer built on the

core elements of Hadoop (HDFS and MapReduce). It

provides users who know SQL with a simple SQL-lite

implementation called HiveQL without sacrificing access via

mappers and reducers.

As a result, Hive is best used for data mining and deeper

analytics that do not require real-time behaviors.[12] Hive

uses three mechanisms for data organization : Tables ,

Partitions and Buckets. [17]. Hive, allows SQL developers to

write Hive Query Language (HQL) statements that are similar

to standard SQL statements , HQL statements are broken

down by the Hive service into MapReduce jobs and executed

across a Hadoop cluster. [18]

Pig was initially developed at Yahoo! To allow people using

Hadoop to focus more on analyzing large data sets and spend

less time having to write mapper and reducer programs. Like

actual Pigs, who eat almost anything, the Pig programming

language is designed to handle any kind of data. [18]. Pig was

designed to make Hadoop more approachable and usable by

nondevelopers. [17]

PROPOSED FRAMEWORK

The proposed EDP is envisioned to be a core tool for all

students and learning agencies, providing support for many

types of views and content/instructional resources to allow

effective data-driven decision-making for students, teacher

and the public, based on recent standards [19].

To support this vision, the solution architecture must have the

following characteristics:

 Accessibility of data and content anywhere and anytime by students, public, teachers, and other

educators at home, school, and via mobile devices.

 Scalability to accommodate students, public, and teachers/principals/other educators.

 Extensibility of functionality in the system environment.

 Extensibility of the technology architecture to support integration with the Shared Learning

Infrastructure (SLI).

The following diagram provides a graphical view of the

proposed architecture for EDP.

Figure 2. Archetcture of EDP

The Data Dashboard is highly scalable and extensible

architecture that will grow, if necessary, to meet the needs of

students, and educators. It also supports:

 Clustering/acceleration-offers a framework to cluster application components for load balancing.

 Caching-offers a framework to cluster application components to share runtime data, as well as data

caching mechanism for increased performance.

 Event logging-it has a centralized logging framework to enables tracking user operations done

via the exposed user interfaces.

 Security -as it supports a secure (SSL) login .

 Notificatios-it has a powerful event publish with many channels of notification.

IMPLEMNTATION

We implement the proposed framework in third author

website http://el-dosuky.com . Each student, either under

graduate or post-graduate , has a profile in the web site, as

shown in the next fugure.

Figure 3. Sample student profile

Volume 90- No.19, March 2014

To access or modify one's data, student is asked to enter

credentials, as shown in fugure 4.

Figure 6. Administration

Figure 7. XP look and feel

The website has access to the student affaire data warehouse,

this enables courses to tracks students scoring, as shoen in the

following figures.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

The proposed EDP is envisioned to be a core tool for all

students and learning agencies, providing support for many

types of views and content/instructional resources to allow

effective data-driven decision-making for students, teacher

and the public, based on recent standards. It supports:

 Accessibility of data and content anywhere and anytime by students, public, teachers, and other educators at home, school, and via mobile devices.

 Scalability to accommodate students, public, and teachers/principals/other educators.

 Extensibility of functionality in the system environment.

 Extensibility of the technology architecture to support integration with the Shared Learning

Infrastructure (SLI).

The Data Dashboard is highly scalable and extensible

architecture that will grow, if necessary, to meet the needs of

students, and educators. In the future we plan to extend the

underlying infrastructure, as well as linking it with many other

databases. Also, we would like to incorporate other services

such as recommending subjects for students [20] and opinion

mining [21].
